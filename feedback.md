# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations**. Excellent job on your user stories! It was nice to see you divide them between current, backlog, and icebox. Consider
using a Trello board for this sort of thing in the future.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Nice job getting the cards to flip back over! It would be nice if the user could see how many moves it took them or how long
to solve the puzzle, but your implementation suggests mastery of dom manipulation!

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. I recommend choosing more semantic variable names and creating variables for commonly used jQuery selectors. For example,
`tile` holds the user's guesses, so maybe `var userGuessCards = []`

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Exceeds Expectations**. I actually started by grading your `master` branch, but then noticed you had made some progress on the `gh-pages`
branch. I was really happy to see you got the cards to flip over / stay depending on whether they match or not. Nice job on Project 1!

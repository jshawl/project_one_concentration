Five user stories for my concentration project

As the admin, I want to present 16 face-down cards (eight pairs of matching cards)
to begin the game. - ok

As a player, I want to click on a "card" to change it from "face-down" to "face-up"
so that I can see what its value is. - ok

As a player, I want to select a second card to see if it matches the first card. -ok

As the game admin, I want the selected cards to stay face-up if they match so they
are no longer part of the game.

As the game admin, I want the selected cards to revert to face-down if they do not match.

As the game admin, I want the game to end when all cards have been matched so the
player knows the game is over.

As a player, I want to be able to reset the board to play again. -ok
